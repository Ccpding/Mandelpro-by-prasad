# Mandelpro-by-prasad
The app Mandelpro to give user friendly interface to enjoy the complex maths in view. Created by Prasad

Sorry for the code file. As this project is done from the android the upload limit is 25 mb only and the app is of 33.60 mb. I request u to build the app and use it.

**Mandelpro** is a high-performance visualization tool designed to explore the infinite complexity of the Mandelbrot set and other fractal geometries.

## 🚀 Features

* **High-Resolution Rendering:** Crisp visualizations of complex mathematical sets.
* **Smooth Zooming:** Explore deep into the fractal structures.
* **Custom Color Palettes:** Dynamic mapping of iteration counts to vibrant colors.
* **Optimized Performance:** Efficient calculation algorithms for mobile and desktop environments.

## 🛠️ Installation

Since this project contains a 33MB application file, you can download the latest version directly from the repository.

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Ccpding/Mandelpro-by-prasad.git](https://github.com/Ccpding/Mandelpro-by-prasad.git)
    ```
2.  Navigate to the directory:
    ```bash
    cd Mandelpro-by-prasad
    ```
3.  Run the application file (or install the APK if on Android).

## 🧮 How it Works

The Mandelbrot set is defined by the set of complex numbers $c$ for which the iterative function does not diverge to infinity:

$$z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c$$

Where:
* $z$ starts at $0$.
* $c$ is the coordinate of the point in the complex plane.
